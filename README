pychromecastweb

pychromecastweb is a web application that allows you to browse parts of
the local filesystem and cast videos to a Chromecast.

This is in a very rough state. To do something, follow the instructions
below, go to /admin/, create a media source pointing to folders with
media files, go back to /, browse and cast.

DEVELOPMENT

$ pipenv install --python 3.6 -e .[dev]
$ pipenv run python manage.py migrate
$ pipenv run python manage.py createsuperuser
$ CAST_HOST=<ip of your host> pipenv run python manage.py runserver

Chromecasts seem to use Google's public DNS servers, so you need to
specify which host should the Chromecast use to reach the embedded web
server for media files.
